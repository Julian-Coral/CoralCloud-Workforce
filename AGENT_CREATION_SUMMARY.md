## 💰 Cost Estimation

**Per Agent Run:**
- Input tokens: ~2,000-5,000
- Output tokens: ~1,500-4,000
- Cost per run: ~$0.05-0.20

**Weekly Costs (estimated):**
- Growth: 5 runs x $0.10 = $0.50
- Business: 5 runs x $0.10 = $0.50
- Finance: 1 run x $0.15 = $0.15
- Strategic: 1 run x $0.20 = $0.20
- Retail: 0.5 runs x $0.15 = $0.08

**Total: ~$1.43/week or ~$6.20/month**

(Actual costs may vary based on input size and Claude API pricing)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**
- API key stored in GitHub Secrets (not in code)
- `.gitignore` includes sensitive files
- Agents commit with service account (not personal)
- `[skip ci]` in commits to prevent loops

⚠️ **Important:**
- Never commit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repo
- Review Growth Agent posts before publishing to LinkedIn
- Verify Finance Agent numbers before making decisions
- Business Agent proposals need human review before sending

---

After 1 month, you should see:
- ✅ 20+ LinkedIn post drafts generated
- ✅ 4 Weekly Founder Reports
- ✅ 4 Finance summaries
- ✅ 20+ Business pipeline checks
- ✅ 2-4 Retail technical assets
- ✅ All agents running on schedule

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **System integration:** Connect Zoho Books and MoneyBird for automated data flow
2. **Process documentation:** Create step-by-step guide for weekly finance updates
3. **Alert setup:** Define thresholds for runway warnings (e.g., <3 months = critical)

## üí¨ Finance Agent Notes

This is my first report, and I've identified a critical gap: **no financial data infrastructure exists yet**. This is not unusual for a new agent system, but it requires immediate attention.

**My commitment:** Once data systems are established, I will provide:
- Precise runway calculations
- Trend analysis with visual indicators
- Proactive risk flagging
- Compliance deadline tracking
- Actionable financial recommendations

**I'm ready to work - I just need the data to analyze.**

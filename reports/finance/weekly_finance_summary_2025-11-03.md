## ⚠️ Alerts & Actions Required

### 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY

1. **IMMEDIATE: Establish Financial Tracking**
   - **Issue:** Zero financial data in system
   - **Impact:** Cannot calculate runway, monitor burn rate, or make informed decisions
   - **Action:** Populate Finance_Tracker.csv with:
     - Current cash positions (UAE Zoho Books + NL MoneyBird)
     - Historical transactions (minimum last 3 months)
     - All income and expense entries
   - **Owner:** Finance Agent + Founder
   - **Deadline:** Within 48 hours

2. **IMMEDIATE: Compliance Calendar Setup**
   - **Issue:** No compliance deadlines tracked
   - **Impact:** Risk of missed VAT filings, tax deadlines, penalties
   - **Action:** Populate Compliance_Calendar.csv with:
     - UAE VAT filing deadlines (quarterly)
     - Netherlands tax obligations
     - Corporate filing requirements
     - Banking/regulatory deadlines
   - **Owner:** Finance Agent + Founder
   - **Deadline:** Within 48 hours

3. **URGENT: Connect to Source Systems**
   - **Issue:** No integration with Zoho Books (UAE) or MoneyBird (NL)
   - **Impact:** Manual data entry required, high error risk
   - **Action:** Establish API connections or export protocols
   - **Owner:** Technical + Finance Agent
   - **Deadline:** Within 1 week

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Establish Financial Reporting Cadence**
   - Set up weekly data refresh process
   - Define KPIs and thresholds for alerts
   - Create baseline financial model

5. **Multi-Currency Management**
   - Confirm AED and EUR tracking methodology
   - Establish exchange rate policy for reporting
   - Decide on primary reporting currency

### Recommendations

1. **Data Foundation First:** Before any analysis can be meaningful, we need baseline data. Prioritize populating the Finance_Tracker.csv with at least:
   - Opening cash balance (as of 2025-10-01)
   - All October 2025 transactions
   - Current cash position (as of 2025-11-03)

2. **Compliance Risk Mitigation:** Even without financial data, compliance deadlines are fixed. Immediately document:
   - Next UAE VAT filing due date
   - Netherlands tax obligations for Q4 2025
   - Any pending regulatory requirements

3. **Minimum Viable Tracking:** Start simple:
   - Weekly cash position snapshots
   - Monthly revenue/expense summaries
   - Quarterly compliance checklist

4. **Automation Investment:** Once manual process is stable, invest in:
   - API integrations with accounting systems
   - Automated data pulls and reconciliation
   - Alert systems for low runway/missed deadlines

## 📈 Projections

**⚠️ Cannot generate projections without baseline data**

### What We Need to Calculate:

- **Runway at current burn:** Requires: Current cash + Average monthly expenses
- **Break-even required:** Requires: Fixed costs + Variable costs
- **Cash position in 30 days:** Requires: Current cash + Expected income - Expected expenses

### Placeholder Assumptions (TO BE VALIDATED):

If we assume typical early-stage SaaS/consulting business:
- **Estimated monthly burn:** €5,000-€10,000 (salary + operations)
- **Minimum safe runway:** 6 months (€30,000-€60,000 cash needed)
- **Break-even target:** €8,000-€12,000/month recurring revenue

**These are ESTIMATES ONLY and must be replaced with actual data immediately.**

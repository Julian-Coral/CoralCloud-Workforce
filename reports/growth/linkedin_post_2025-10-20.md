Most SAP Retail implementations fail before they even start.

Not because of technical issues.
Not because of budget overruns.

They fail because teams confuse "configuration" with "transformation."

Here's what I see happen repeatedly:

Companies spend months configuring every single field in SAP CAR. They map every article attribute, every store hierarchy level, every pricing condition. The system becomes a perfect mirror of their current processes.

Then they wonder why nothing improved.

Configuration is necessary. But it's not transformation.

Transformation happens when you ask: "What if we didn't do it this way?"

What if stores didn't need 47 approval steps for markdowns?
What if article masters weren't duplicated across 12 systems?
What if allocation decisions took hours, not weeks?

The best SAP Retail projects I've seen start with a simple exercise:

Map your current process. Then delete everything that exists because "that's how we've always done it." Only add back what creates actual value.

Your SAP system should enable new ways of working, not just digitize old problems.

Start with transformation. Configure second.

What's one process in your organization that gets configured the same way every time, even though everyone knows there's a better approach?

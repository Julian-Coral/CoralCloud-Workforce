Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same point.

It's not the technology. It's not the budget. It's not even the timeline.

It's the moment when business requirements meet technical reality, and no one in the room speaks both languages.

I've sat in too many workshops where the merchandising team describes their perfect promotion flow, the technical team nods politely, and three months later, everyone's surprised the system doesn't work as expected.

Here's what changed my approach:

Stop translating. Start interpreting.

A translator converts words. An interpreter conveys meaning.

When a buyer says "I need flexibility in my assortment planning," they're not asking for more configuration tables. They're saying their market changes faster than their planning cycles.

When IT says "that requires custom development," they're not being difficult. They're protecting system stability because they've seen what happens when core processes break.

The best consultants I know don't pick sides. They build bridges.

They help business teams understand why certain "simple" requests have complex implications. They help technical teams see the revenue impact of saying "that's not standard."

This is why I spend more time in my first project week listening than talking. Understanding context beats delivering solutions every time.

What's your experience? Where do you see the biggest communication gaps in enterprise implementations?

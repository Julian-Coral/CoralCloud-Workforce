Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same point.

It's not during configuration. It's not during testing.
It's 6 months after go-live, when the business realizes the system doesn't match how they actually work.

Here's what I've learned after 15+ years:

The problem isn't technical capability. SAP IS-Retail and CAR are incredibly powerful. The problem is the gap between "standard process" and "our process."

Standard SAP assumes you operate like a German department store chain from 1995. But you're a fast-fashion brand with 200 stores across 8 countries. Or a luxury retailer with concessions and consignments. Or an omnichannel player where every transaction touches 3 systems.

The real work isn't in the SAP configuration manual.

It's in these conversations:
- How do you actually handle returns across channels?
- What happens when inventory is wrong at POS?
- Who owns pricing when merchandising and finance disagree?
- How do promotions really get executed in stores?

I call this "retail reality mapping" - documenting what actually happens vs. what the process manual says happens.

When you skip this step, you get:
→ Workarounds that become permanent
→ Data quality issues that compound monthly  
→ Users who hate the system (and work around it more)
→ Leadership questioning the entire investment

The best implementations I've seen? They spent 40% of project time just mapping reality. Understanding the exceptions, the edge cases, the "yeah but what about when..." scenarios.

Then they built a system that worked with the business, not against it.

What's your experience? Have you seen this gap between system design and business reality?

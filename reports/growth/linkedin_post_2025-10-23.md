Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same point.

It's not the technical setup. It's not the configuration.

It's the article master.

I've seen companies spend 6 months building the perfect S/4HANA Fashion environment. Everything works in testing. Data migration looks clean. Integration tests pass.

Then they flip the switch on article master data.

Chaos.

Here's what happens: Teams underestimate the complexity of retail master data. They treat articles like regular materials. They don't account for variants, seasons, collections, and the web of relationships that make retail different.

The result? Go-live delays. Data quality issues. Business users losing trust.

The fix isn't more technology. It's understanding that retail master data is fundamentally different:

• One article = dozens of variants (size, color, fit)
• Hierarchies matter (collection → theme → article group)
• Seasons drive everything (not just planning cycles)
• Pricing and promotions need clean structures from day one

Before your next S/4HANA Retail project, ask this question: "Do we truly understand our article master architecture?"

If there's hesitation, pause. Get that foundation right first.

What's been your experience with retail master data migrations? Where did complexity surprise you?

Based on the available data and the focus on content variety, here's a compelling LinkedIn post for Friday:

```
Most SAP consultants can tell you how to configure a system.

Few can tell you why it's configured that way.

I spent 15 years learning that the "why" matters more than the "how."

Here's what I mean:

A client once asked me to set up promotional pricing in SAP Retail. Standard request. I could've done it in a day.

Instead, I asked: "What happens when a promotion overlaps with a customer-specific discount?"

Silence.

Turns out, their business rules weren't documented. Marketing and Finance had different assumptions. IT was stuck in the middle.

We spent three days mapping the actual business logic before touching SAP.

Result? The system worked exactly as the business needed—not just as the software allowed.

This is the gap I see constantly:
- Technical expertise without business context = fragile solutions
- Business requirements without technical reality = unrealistic expectations
- Both together = systems that actually drive value

After 15 years in SAP Retail and Fashion, I've learned that the best consultants are translators—not just configurators.

We bridge the gap between "what the business wants" and "what the system can do."

That's where real value lives.

What's your experience? Have you seen projects succeed or fail based on this gap?

Most companies treat LinkedIn like a billboard.

Post. Wait. Hope someone notices.

But here's what I've learned after 15 years in SAP Retail consulting:

The best opportunities don't come from broadcasting. They come from conversations.

Last month, a simple comment on someone's S/4HANA migration post led to a 3-hour call. They weren't even looking for consultants. But they had questions. Real ones.

That's the difference.

When you engage authentically—not to sell, but to help—people remember. When they (or someone they know) needs expertise, you're the first call.

LinkedIn isn't a lead generation machine. It's a relationship-building platform that happens to generate leads.

The metric that matters isn't impressions. It's: "How many meaningful conversations did I have this week?"

For me, that number needs to be higher.

So here's my challenge to myself (and maybe to you):

This week, comment on 5 posts with genuine insights. Not "Great post!" but actual value. Ask thoughtful questions. Share relevant experiences.

See what happens.

What's one conversation you had on LinkedIn that turned into something unexpected?

**Rationale for this post:**

Given the context shows empty pipeline and zero active opportunities, this post serves multiple strategic purposes:

1. **Addresses the root problem**: Not enough meaningful conversations happening
2. **Demonstrates self-awareness**: Acknowledges the need to improve (authentic)
3. **Provides value**: Reframes LinkedIn strategy from broadcasting to engagement
4. **Includes proof**: References real experience (15 years, specific example)
5. **Actionable**: Gives concrete challenge (5 comments this week)
6. **Engagement driver**: Ends with open question to prompt responses

This post positions Joost as someone who understands business development at a deeper level while being honest about the work required—much more compelling than another "5 tips" post.

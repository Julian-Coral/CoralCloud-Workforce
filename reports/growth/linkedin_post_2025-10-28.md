Most SAP Retail migrations fail not because of technical complexity.

They fail because teams underestimate the business logic embedded in 15 years of customizations.

I've watched companies spend â‚¬2M on S/4HANA upgrades, only to realize their pricing logic doesn't translate. Their promotion engine breaks. Their POS integration needs a complete rebuild.

Here's what the Big 4 consultants won't tell you upfront:

Your custom ABAP code for article hierarchies? Needs rewriting.
That clever workaround for multi-currency pricing? Obsolete in S/4HANA.
The batch jobs running your replenishment? Different performance profile entirely.

The companies that succeed do three things differently:

1. They audit their customizations BEFORE the technical migration starts
2. They rebuild core retail processes in S/4HANA's native logic (not lift-and-shift)
3. They accept that some "enhancements" were actually workarounds for poor design

One client saved 6 months of rework by discovering their promotion engine could be replaced by standard S/4HANA Fashion functionality. They'd assumed they needed custom code.

If you're planning an SAP Retail to S/4HANA migration: invest heavily in the business process review. The technical migration is the easy part.

What's been your experience with ERP migrations? Where did the surprises come from?

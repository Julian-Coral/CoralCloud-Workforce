Most SAP Retail implementations fail not because of bad technology.

They fail because of bad questions.

I've spent 15 years watching companies ask "How do we implement SAP Retail?" when they should be asking "What problem are we actually solving?"

Here's what I mean:

A fashion retailer once hired me after spending 18 months on a CAR implementation. Millions invested. The system worked perfectly. But nobody used it.

Why? Because they built what the vendor recommended, not what the business needed.

The real question wasn't "How do we implement CAR?" It was "How do our buyers make decisions today, and what data would actually change those decisions?"

Different question. Different solution. Different outcome.

This pattern repeats everywhere:

"How do we migrate to S/4HANA?" → Wrong question.
Better: "Which processes will break if we don't migrate, and which will improve if we do?"

"How do we integrate POS data?" → Wrong question.
Better: "What decisions require real-time store data versus batch processing?"

"How do we fix our master data?" → Wrong question.
Better: "Where does bad data actually cost us money, and how much?"

The best consultants I know spend more time asking questions than answering them.

The worst ones arrive with solutions before understanding the problem.

After 15+ years in SAP Retail, I've learned this: Technology is easy. Understanding what problem you're solving is hard.

What's the most important question you ask before starting a project?

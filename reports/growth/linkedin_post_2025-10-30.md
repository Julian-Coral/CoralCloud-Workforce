The empty pipeline is your biggest risk right now.

But here's what most consultants miss:

People don't buy SAP expertise.
They buy solutions to problems keeping them up at night.

I learned this the hard way after 15+ years in SAP Retail.

The best proposals I ever sent weren't about my credentials.
They were about the client's pain points.

Three questions that changed my approach:

→ What's the cost of doing nothing?
→ What's the specific outcome they need?
→ Can I prove I've solved this exact problem before?

When you shift from "here's what I know" to "here's what you'll achieve," everything changes.

Your expertise matters. But only when it's wrapped in their business case.

What's the #1 objection you hear when pitching consulting services?

- Target audience: SAP consultants, Independent consultants, Freelancers
- Expected engagement: Medium-High

**Reasoning:**
Given the consistent "empty pipeline" theme across all recent reports, this post addresses the core challenge facing CoralCloud right now - but frames it as a learning moment that provides value to the broader consulting community. It's authentic (drawn from real experience), actionable (three specific questions), and ends with an engagement hook that invites conversation. The post avoids being salesy while subtly positioning CoralCloud's experience and approach.

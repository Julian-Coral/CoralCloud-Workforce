It's Friday afternoon in the SAP world.

You've spent 15 years in the trenches of retail systems. You know what works. You know what breaks.

And you know that most "best practices" are just expensive ways to repeat other people's mistakes.

Here's what I've learned about making SAP Retail actually work:

**1. Master data is never "just" master data**
Your article hierarchy will haunt you for years. Design it once, design it right. Every shortcut you take today becomes a migration nightmare tomorrow.

**2. POS integration isn't a technical problem**
It's a trust problem. When store managers don't trust the numbers, they create shadow systems. Fix the data quality first, then worry about real-time feeds.

**3. CAR is only as good as your questions**
Customer analytics without business questions is just expensive data storage. Start with "What decision will this insight change?" Work backward from there.

**4. S/4HANA migration isn't about technology**
It's about admitting which customizations you built because you had to, and which ones you built because you could. Kill your darlings. The code you wrote 10 years ago doesn't need to live forever.

**5. Training documentation is a love letter to your future self**
That integration you built? You'll forget how it works in 6 months. Your replacement will curse your name if you don't write it down. Be kind to future you.

The best consultants I know don't have all the answers.

They just ask better questions than everyone else.

And they write things down.

What's one SAP lesson you wish you'd learned earlier?

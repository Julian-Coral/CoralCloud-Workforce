Based on the available data, I'll create a LinkedIn post focused on educational content about SAP Retail, as this aligns with CoralCloud's expertise and the need to build brand awareness.

Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the master data stage.

Not because of bad technology. Because of bad planning.

I've seen it dozens of times: Companies rush to configure the system, thinking master data is just "data entry work" they can figure out later.

Then go-live hits. And reality hits harder.

Suddenly, you can't process promotions because your article hierarchy is wrong. Your POS systems reject transactions because site data doesn't match. Pricing won't calculate because assortment lists are incomplete.

The fix? Weeks of emergency cleanup. Frustrated users. Lost revenue.

Here's what successful implementations do differently:

**They design master data BEFORE configuration:**
- Article master structure that matches business processes
- Site hierarchies that support both operations and reporting  
- Customer master that enables the segmentation you actually need

**They validate early and often:**
- Test data loads in development, not production
- Run pricing simulations before go-live
- Verify POS integration with real scenarios

**They build governance from day one:**
- Clear ownership (who maintains what)
- Quality rules (what's mandatory vs. optional)
- Change processes (how to add new articles, sites, etc.)

Master data isn't glamorous. But it's the foundation everything else sits on.

Get it right, and your SAP Retail system hums. Get it wrong, and you're fighting fires for years.

What's been your experience with retail master data? What lessons have you learned the hard way?

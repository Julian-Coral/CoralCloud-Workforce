The empty pipeline is a problem that won't solve itself.

Every consultant knows this truth: momentum is everything. When deals are flowing, more deals come. When the pipeline is dry, it gets drier.

I've spent the last 15 years in SAP Retail—leading implementations, fixing broken systems, migrating to S/4HANA. The technical work? That's the easy part.

The hard part is what happens before the project starts.

Here's what I'm seeing right now across the retail tech landscape:

Companies are sitting on SAP ECC systems that are running out of time. The 2027 deadline isn't theoretical anymore. But migration projects are complex, expensive, and risky. Decision-makers are paralyzed.

They need someone who's done it before. Someone who knows where the landmines are buried.

That's where specialized expertise wins. Not the biggest consulting firm. Not the cheapest freelancer. The person who's solved this exact problem 10 times already.

So here's my question for this community:

If you're a retail CIO or IT director sitting on a legacy SAP Retail system, what's the biggest thing stopping you from starting your S/4HANA migration plan?

Is it budget? Internal politics? Fear of disruption? Lack of trusted advisors?

I'm genuinely curious. Because the technical path is clear. It's the business path that's usually the blocker.

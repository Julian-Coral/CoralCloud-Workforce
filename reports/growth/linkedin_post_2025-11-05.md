I'll create a LinkedIn post for Wednesday, November 5th, 2025, focusing on educational content with a SAP Retail theme.

```
Most SAP Retail implementations fail not because of technology.

They fail because teams forget one critical truth: retail is fundamentally different from manufacturing.

I learned this the hard way 15 years ago on my first SAP Retail project. The client kept asking, "Why can't we just use standard SAP MM?"

Here's what makes retail unique:

**The article master complexity**
Manufacturing: One product = one material number
Retail: One t-shirt = 50+ variants (sizes, colors, stores)
Reality: Your article master explodes to millions of records

**The pricing paradox**
Manufacturing: Price per unit, maybe volume discounts
Retail: Time-based promotions, customer segments, loyalty tiers, markdown cycles
Reality: Your pricing engine runs 24/7, not monthly

**The inventory challenge**
Manufacturing: Warehouse-centric, batch tracking
Retail: 500 stores + e-commerce, real-time allocation
Reality: You're orchestrating a distributed supply chain, not managing stock

The teams that succeed? They stop trying to force-fit manufacturing logic into retail operations.

They embrace the complexity. They design for it. They build systems that breathe with the rhythm of retail: seasons, promotions, trends.

SAP Retail (IS-Retail, now S/4HANA Fashion) exists because retail needed its own blueprint. Not because consultants wanted billable hours.

If you're planning an SAP Retail implementation or migration, ask yourself: Are we designing for retail reality, or manufacturing fantasy?

What's the biggest "retail vs. manufacturing" disconnect you've seen in ERP projects?

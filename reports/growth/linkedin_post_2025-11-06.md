Most SAP Retail implementations fail not because of technology.

They fail because of three invisible gaps:

**The Knowledge Gap**
Your team knows SAP. Your team knows retail. But SAP Retail? That's where the expertise vacuum lives. Article hierarchies, allocation logic, POS integration patterns—these aren't in the standard training.

**The Data Gap**
You migrated your master data. But did you migrate the *relationships*? Sites without hierarchies. Articles without attributes. Customers without segments. Clean data that can't actually do anything.

**The Integration Gap**
Your POS talks to SAP. Your warehouse talks to SAP. But do they speak the same language? Mismatched transaction codes, timing misalignments, error handling that silently fails—these are the silent killers.

Here's what I've learned after 15 years:

The best implementations don't start with configuration. They start with a brutal audit of what you actually know, what data you actually have, and what really needs to connect.

Three questions to ask before your next SAP Retail project:
1. Who on your team has implemented *retail-specific* functionality before?
2. Can you trace a single product from creation to POS sale in your current data?
3. What happens when your POS goes offline for 4 hours?

If you can't answer these confidently, you're not ready to configure. You're ready to assess.

**Post Metadata:**
- Primary theme: Thought Leadership / Problem Identification

**Rationale:**

This post addresses the **empty pipeline problem** directly by:

1. **Positioning expertise**: Establishes deep SAP Retail knowledge without bragging
2. **Creating urgency**: Identifies common pain points that prospects are likely experiencing
3. **Offering value**: Provides a practical self-assessment framework
4. **Soft CTA**: Implies CoralCloud's assessment services without hard selling
5. **Engagement hooks**: Three questions encourage comments/discussion

The "failure" framing grabs attention (scrollstopper), the knowledge/data/integration framework provides structure (value), and the questions create engagement opportunity. This positions Julian as someone who understands the *real* problems, not just the technical solutions.

**Strategic note**: This type of post should generate inbound inquiries from people who recognize these gaps in their own organizations. It's designed to surface qualified leads who are already aware they have a problem.

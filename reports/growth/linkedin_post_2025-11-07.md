Looking at the data available, I can see this is Friday (November 7, 2025) and the pipeline has been consistently empty across multiple daily checks. I'll create an engaging post that provides genuine value while subtly positioning CoralCloud's expertise.

Most SAP Retail migrations fail not because of technical complexity.

They fail because companies treat them like IT projects instead of business transformations.

Here's what 15 years in SAP Retail taught me:

The retailers who succeed do three things differently:

1. They map business processes BEFORE touching the system
Too many jump straight into configuration. Result? They replicate broken processes in shiny new software.

2. They involve store operations early
Your DC manager knows more about real-world edge cases than any consultant. Listen to them.

3. They plan for the "boring" stuff
Master data cleanup isn't sexy. But it's the difference between a 6-month project and an 18-month nightmare.

The technical migration? That's actually the easy part.

The hard part is getting merchandising, IT, finance, and store ops to agree on how a promotion should work.

What's your experience with retail system implementations? What surprised you most?

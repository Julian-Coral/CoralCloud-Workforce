Most companies are transforming their SAP systems.

Very few are doing it well.

I spent 15 years watching retailers struggle with SAP Retail and CAR implementations. The patterns are predictable:

→ Underestimating data complexity
→ Ignoring retail-specific nuances
→ Treating POS integration as an afterthought
→ Copying what worked for manufacturing

Here's what actually works:

Start with your customer data strategy. Not your ERP strategy.

In retail, everything flows from understanding customer behavior. Your SAP Retail setup should enable that understanding, not constrain it.

CAR (Customer Activity Repository) isn't just another module. It's the bridge between transactional systems and customer intelligence. Get this wrong, and you're flying blind.

The retailers who succeed treat their SAP transformation as a business capability upgrade, not a technical migration.

They ask: "What customer insights do we need?" before "Which SAP modules do we implement?"

What's your experience with retail system transformations? What worked (or didn't)?

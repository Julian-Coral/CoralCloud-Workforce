Based on the provided data, I'll create an engaging LinkedIn post for Tuesday, November 11, 2025. Given the empty pipeline and focus on building awareness, I'll create an **Educational** post about a common SAP Retail challenge.

```
Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same point.

It's not the technology. It's not the budget.

It's the master data.

I've seen retailers spend millions on S/4HANA Fashion, only to realize their article master is a mess. Duplicate SKUs, inconsistent hierarchies, missing attributes—the works.

Here's what happens:
→ Go-live gets delayed 3-6 months
→ Reports show garbage data
→ Users lose trust in the system
→ Business value? Never realized.

The fix isn't sexy. But it works:

1. **Audit before you migrate** - Run data quality checks on your current system. Know what you're dealing with.

2. **Define standards early** - Article numbering, naming conventions, mandatory fields. Non-negotiable.

3. **Clean as you go** - Don't migrate dirty data hoping to "fix it later." Later never comes.

4. **Automate validation** - Build checks into your migration scripts. Catch errors before they hit production.

5. **Train your team** - The best master data governance is people who understand why it matters.

I've helped retailers clean up millions of article records. The ones who invest in data quality upfront? They see ROI within months.

The ones who skip it? They're still fighting fires years later.

What's your biggest SAP Retail data challenge? Drop it in the comments.

1. **Hook**: Opens with a contrarian statement (technology isn't the problem) to grab attention

2. **Relatability**: Master data issues are universal in SAP Retail—this will resonate with the target audience

3. **Authority**: Demonstrates deep expertise without being salesy ("I've helped retailers clean up millions of article records")

4. **Actionable value**: Provides 5 concrete steps readers can implement

5. **Engagement driver**: Ends with a question to spark comments

6. **Positioning**: Subtly positions CoralCloud as the expert who's "been there, done that" on S/4HANA migrations

7. **Timing**: With 2027 ECC support deadline looming, S/4HANA migration content is highly relevant

This post aligns with the Business Agent's identified opportunities (S/4HANA migration projects) while providing genuine educational value—not just promotion.

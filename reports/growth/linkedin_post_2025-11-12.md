I'll create a LinkedIn post for Wednesday, November 12, 2025, rotating through content themes while providing value.

Based on the available data, I can see:
- Empty pipeline across all Business Agent reports
- No recent LinkedIn engagement data
- Focus on SAP Retail, S/4HANA migration, and CAR expertise
- Need to establish thought leadership and generate inbound leads

Given it's Wednesday (mid-week), I'll create an **Educational** post that provides actionable insight while positioning expertise.

SAP Retail professionals: Your S/4HANA migration timeline just got more complicated.

Here's why most retailers underestimate the effort by 40-60%:

They focus on the technical conversion. But the real work? It's in the retail-specific complexity.

Three areas that consistently derail migrations:

**1. Article Master Data**
Your ECC article master has 15 years of accumulated customizations. Variants, hierarchies, assortment planning logic—none of it maps cleanly to S/4HANA Fashion. Budget 3-4 weeks just for data model reconciliation.

**2. POS Integration**
If you think your current POS interface will "just work" in S/4HANA, think again. Data structures changed. Transaction codes evolved. Real-time requirements increased. Plan for a complete integration redesign.

**3. CAR Migration**
Customer Activity Repository doesn't migrate—it transforms. New data models, different aggregation logic, changed reporting structures. This isn't lift-and-shift; it's rebuild-and-optimize.

The retailers who succeed? They treat S/4HANA migration as a business transformation, not an IT upgrade.

They invest in proper assessment (4-6 weeks), realistic timelines (12-18 months for mid-size), and experienced retail-specific expertise.

The 2027 deadline is real. But rushing is more expensive than planning.

What's your biggest S/4HANA migration concern? Drop it in the comments.

Based on the provided data, I'll create an engaging LinkedIn post for Thursday, November 13, 2025. Given the critical pipeline situation evident in the proposal drafts and the need to generate leads, I'll focus on **Educational content** with a **thought leadership** angle about SAP Retail challenges - this provides value while positioning CoralCloud's expertise.

Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same predictable point.

Not during go-live. Not during testing.

During the "simple" master data setup phase.

I've seen €2M projects derail because teams underestimated article master complexity. Here's what actually happens:

→ Teams treat retail article master like standard MM material master
→ They discover 47 retail-specific fields they didn't plan for
→ Data migration scripts fail because of variant/size grid dependencies
→ Go-live postponed by 8 weeks

The fix isn't more resources. It's understanding that retail master data is fundamentally different:

• Article hierarchies aren't just categories - they drive pricing, promotions, allocation
• Site master isn't just "plant" - it's the backbone of assortment planning
• Customer-article relationships matter in retail (they don't in manufacturing)

After 15 years in SAP Retail, the pattern is always the same: companies that invest 2 weeks upfront in proper data modeling save 3 months in delivery.

What's your experience with retail master data? Have you seen projects stumble here?

**Strategic Notes:**

This post is designed to:
1. **Demonstrate expertise** - 15 years experience, specific technical knowledge
2. **Create urgency** - Highlights a common, expensive problem
3. **Position CoralCloud** - As someone who can prevent these failures
4. **Generate conversations** - Question at end invites engagement
5. **Support pipeline** - Indirectly markets "SAP Retail health check" services mentioned in business proposals

The hook ("Most SAP Retail implementations fail...") creates scroll-stopping curiosity, while the specific example (€2M projects, 47 fields, 8-week delays) adds credibility. The practical insight provides value even to non-prospects, building trust.

Given the empty pipeline situation evident in the data, this post balances immediate value delivery with subtle positioning for consulting inquiries.

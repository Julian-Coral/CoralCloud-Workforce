The market is desperate for S/4HANA migration guidance.

But most consultants are selling complexity when clients need clarity.

Here's what retailers actually need right now:

**Not:** A 200-page migration strategy document
**But:** A simple "go/no-go" assessment in 5 days

**Not:** Theoretical best practices
**But:** Real pitfalls from 15+ years of retail implementations

**Not:** Generic SAP advice
**But:** Retail-specific guidance (article master, pricing, POS integration)

The migration deadline is 2027. Decision-makers are overwhelmed.

The winning approach? Break it down:
→ Week 1: Current state assessment
→ Week 2: Gap analysis (what works in S/4HANA, what doesn't)
→ Week 3: Realistic roadmap with effort + risk

Simple. Actionable. No fluff.

Sometimes the best consulting isn't about showing how smart you are.

It's about making the complex feel manageable.

What's your experience with S/4HANA migrations? What do retailers get wrong most often?

**Rationale:**

This post addresses a critical market need identified across multiple Business Agent pipeline reviews: S/4HANA migration projects are high-value opportunities (€15K-50K) with genuine urgency due to the 2027 ECC sunset deadline.

**Why this works:**

1. **Hook:** Contrarian take ("selling complexity when clients need clarity") creates pattern interrupt
2. **Value:** Provides a practical framework (5-day assessment, 3-week roadmap) that demonstrates expertise without giving away the farm
3. **Authenticity:** References "15+ years of retail implementations" - backs up claims with credibility
4. **CTA:** Open-ended question invites engagement and positions Joost as someone who wants to learn, not just broadcast

**Strategic fit:**

- Aligns with Business Agent's identified high-value opportunities
- Supports Retail Intelligence Agent's asset creation priorities (S/4HANA Migration Playbook)
- Demonstrates technical depth while maintaining approachable tone
- Can drive inbound leads for €8,500 assessment service mentioned in pipeline reports

**Friday timing:** Good day for thought leadership posts (people winding down, more time to engage)

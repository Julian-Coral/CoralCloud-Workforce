I'll create a compelling LinkedIn post for Monday, November 17, 2025, focusing on educational/thought leadership content since we're rotating through themes.

The most expensive SAP Retail implementations aren't the ones with big budgets.

They're the ones that skip the discovery phase.

I've seen companies spend €500K+ on SAP Retail projects that failed because they rushed into implementation without understanding their actual requirements.

Here's what happens:

→ Business assumes SAP works like their old system
→ IT assumes standard SAP will fit their processes
→ Both assume the other knows what they're doing

The result? Six months in, you're doing expensive customizations that could have been avoided with two weeks of proper discovery.

The smart approach:

1. Map your current processes (yes, all of them)
2. Identify what MUST be different vs. what SHOULD change
3. Challenge assumptions with "why do we do it this way?"
4. Document the gaps before writing a single line of code

A €15K discovery phase can save you €200K in rework.

Ask me how I know.

What's the most expensive "shortcut" you've seen in enterprise software projects?

**Rationale for this post:**

1. **Hook effectiveness**: Opens with a counter-intuitive statement that challenges conventional wisdom about project costs

2. **Authority building**: Demonstrates deep implementation experience without explicitly stating credentials (the "ask me how I know" is more powerful)

3. **Practical value**: Provides a clear 4-step framework readers can actually use

4. **Authentic voice**: Conversational, direct, no corporate jargon

5. **Engagement driver**: Ends with an open question that invites others to share their experiences

6. **Positioning**: Subtly positions CoralCloud as the expert who prevents these costly mistakes

7. **No fluff**: Every sentence adds value - no filler, no buzzwords, no empty hype

This type of post typically performs well because:
- It's based on real experience (not theory)
- It solves a painful, expensive problem
- It's specific enough to be credible but broad enough to resonate
- The question at the end encourages comments (which boosts reach)

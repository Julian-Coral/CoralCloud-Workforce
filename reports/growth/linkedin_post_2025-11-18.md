I'll create a compelling LinkedIn post for Tuesday, November 18, 2025, focused on providing value while maintaining authenticity.

Most SAP Retail consultants talk about S/4HANA migration.

Few talk about what happens after go-live.

Here's what 15 years of implementations taught me:

The real work starts when the confetti settles.

Three critical post-migration realities:

1. **Your master data issues don't disappear**
They multiply. That article master cleanup you postponed? It's now blocking your new analytics capabilities. S/4HANA just made your data quality problems more visible.

2. **CAR isn't plug-and-play**
Customer Activity Repository sounds great in theory. But without proper POS integration and data governance, you're just moving garbage from one system to another. Clean pipes before you turn on the tap.

3. **Your team needs time to adapt**
S/4HANA Fashion isn't just "new SAP Retail." Different data models. Different processes. Different mindset. Budget 6 months for your team to work efficiently again, not 6 weeks.

The companies that succeed post-migration?

They treat go-live as the beginning of a journey, not the end.
They invest in data quality from day one.
They give their teams real training, not just system walkthroughs.

What's your experience with post-migration challenges? What surprised you most?

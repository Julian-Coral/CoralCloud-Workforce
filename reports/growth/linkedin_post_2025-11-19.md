Looking at the available data, I can see we're on Day 6 of the week (Wednesday) and there's no recent engagement data or content context available. Let me create a valuable, engaging LinkedIn post focused on one of the core themes.

Since it's mid-week and we want to maintain variety, I'll create an **Educational** post with a **Thought Leadership** angle about a common SAP Retail challenge.

```
Most SAP Retail implementations fail at the same point.

It's not the technology. It's not the budget.

It's the moment when IT says "the system works" and the business says "but it doesn't do what we need."

I've seen this exact scenario play out across 15 years of implementations. The gap between technical success and business value.

Here's what actually works:

Start with business processes, not SAP modules. Map how your stores actually work today—the workarounds, the spreadsheets, the manual fixes. That's your real requirement.

Involve store managers early. Not in month 8 when you're ready for UAT. In week 1 when you're defining scope. They know what breaks at 6 PM on Saturday.

Build for the exception, not the rule. Your happy path works fine in any system. It's the returns without receipts, the damaged goods, the pricing overrides—that's where systems earn their keep.

The best implementations I've worked on weren't the ones with the cleanest code. They were the ones where the store manager could train a new employee in 20 minutes instead of 2 days.

Technical excellence matters. But it's in service of business simplicity.

What's your experience? Where have you seen the IT-business gap cause the most friction?

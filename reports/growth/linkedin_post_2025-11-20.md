# SAP Retail S/4HANA Migration: 5 Critical Success Factors

Most retail S/4HANA migrations fail not because of technical complexity, but because teams overlook the fundamentals.

After 15+ years implementing SAP Retail systems, here's what actually matters:

**1. Master Data First**
Your article master, site hierarchy, and assortment data must be pristine before migration. Clean it now or pay 10x later in S/4HANA.

**2. Don't Underestimate CAR**
Customer Activity Repository isn't just "another module" - it's a complete architectural shift. Plan 30% more time than you think.

**3. POS Integration Reality Check**
Your POS interfaces will need redesign. Period. Budget for it upfront rather than discovering it mid-project.

**4. Retail-Specific Testing**
Generic S/4HANA test scripts miss retail nuances. You need scenarios for promotions, markdowns, multi-channel pricing, and seasonal assortments.

**5. Training ≠ Documentation**
Your team needs hands-on experience with S/4HANA's new UX and embedded analytics. Reading guides won't cut it.

The 2027 ECC deadline is closer than it feels. Start planning now.

What's been your biggest S/4HANA migration challenge?

I'll create a LinkedIn post for Friday, November 21, 2025, focusing on providing valuable insight while maintaining authenticity.

```
The hardest part of digital transformation isn't the technology.

It's the 15-year-old Excel sheet that "just works."

I've seen €50M retailers hesitate on SAP upgrades because someone's macro-filled spreadsheet has become mission-critical. No documentation. No backup. Just institutional knowledge living in one person's laptop.

Here's what I've learned about modernization resistance:

The Excel sheet isn't the enemy. It represents something that solved a real problem when the system couldn't. That's valuable insight.

Your job isn't to eliminate workarounds—it's to understand why they exist, then build something better that people actually want to use.

Three questions that change the conversation:

1. "What does this spreadsheet do that the system doesn't?"
2. "What would make you trust the new system more than your current process?"
3. "What's the worst thing that could happen if we got this wrong?"

The answers reveal the real requirements—not the ones in the project spec.

Digital transformation succeeds when you respect the wisdom in the workarounds while building systems that make them obsolete.

What's the most creative workaround you've encountered in enterprise systems?

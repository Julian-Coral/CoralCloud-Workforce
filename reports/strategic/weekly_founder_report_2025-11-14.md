## 💰 Financial Health

### Current Status: ⚠️ **UNKNOWN - NO DATA AVAILABLE**

  - Zoho Books (UAE operations)
  - MoneyBird (Netherlands operations)
- ❌ No data exported to Finance_Tracker.csv

**What We Need:**
1. **Immediate (24 hours):** Current cash positions (UAE AED + NL EUR)

3. **This week:** All known compliance deadlines documented

**Estimated Baseline (Unvalidated Assumptions):**
- Typical early-stage burn: €5K-10K/month
- Minimum safe runway: 6 months (€30K-60K cash)

**⚠️ These are estimates only. Actual data required immediately.**
